Since the motor for the quadrocopter has already been selected, the right propeller must now be chosen. The following aspects are considered:

 1. Number of Blades: Typically, quadrocopters have between two and four blades. The use of multiple blades can help to reduce the diameter of the propeller, but at the cost of energy efficiency, as increased turbulence increases drag. Since for our application the flight time carries a greater value than the size of the drone, we decide to use a propeller with two blades.
 2. Diameter: Since the motor has only a KV value of 1000, the rotational speed of the propeller is relatively low. Therefore, to achieve sufficient lift, we need relatively large propellers. In addition, large propellers run smoother and lead to a more stable flight. Therefore, we decide to use a diameter of 10 inches (254mm).
 3. Pitch: Since the motor has a fairly low torque, we need a lower pitch to reduce the load on the motor. An educated guess leads to a pitch of 4.5 inches (114.3mm).

Therefore, we need a 10x4.5x2 propeller. (diameter [inch] x pitch [inch] x number of blades [ ])

The following propeller was selected: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01LNE1EJ2/?coliid=I3GIRK983115H5&colid=1UCTN9GNXW2B1&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
This product is especially suitable because four right and four left turning propellers are offered for a reasonable price and a good delivery time. (Different rotational directions are needed to compensate for the resulting torque and enable yaw controll).
