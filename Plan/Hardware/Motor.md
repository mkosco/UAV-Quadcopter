The chosen motor for the quadrocopter is the A2212 / 13T 1000KV.
It was chosen for the following reasons:

 1. Budget Constraints: Since Lukas already owns four of these motors, those could be used to save money.
 2. Accessibility: This motor is inexpensive and sold by many vendors. Damaged motors can be replaced cheaply with short delivery times.
 3. Power: Since the quadrocopter is not designed for high speed and fast maneuvers, the power of the motor should be adequate.
